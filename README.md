# Pygameproject
Got it, Usman! You want to provide **clear instructions** in your GitHub or Google Drive repository so your teacher (or anyone) can **run your Pygame game** — where your main file is named:

> `code game (1).py`

Here’s a professional and clear **README-style instruction** you can include in a `README.txt` or `README.md` file — or just copy-paste in your email or GitHub description:

---

## 🕹️ Instructions to Run the Game

### 📁 File Name:

**`code game (1).py`**

### 🧱 Requirements:

Before running the game, make sure the following are installed:

* Python **3.8+**
* `pygame` library

You can install `pygame` using:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

> ✅ If you get an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'`, it means `pygame` isn't installed yet.

---

### ▶️ How to Run the Game

1. **Download or clone the project folder**.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where `code game (1).py` is located.

For example:

```bash
cd path/to/your/folder
```

4. Run the game with:

```bash
python "code game (1).py"
```

(Make sure to include the quotes because of the space and parentheses in the filename.)

### 🎮 Controls:

* `↑ ↓ ← →` — Move Snake (Manual Mode)
* `A` — Toggle AI Mode (BFS)
* `P` — Pause/Resume
* `R` — Restart Game
* `+ / -` — Adjust Speed

---

### 🔚 Game Over:

* The game ends if the snake hits a wall or itself.
* Press `R` to restart.
